# FormQuest

FormQuest is an open source, self-hosted application for creating form endpoints
that designers and developers can use to collect form submissions.

Capture form submissions with FormQuest from HTML5 forms or AJAX. FormQuest is
a great way to collect user submissions from static websites and mobile apps.
FormQuest comes with its own admin interface for viewing form submissions. You
can even invite collaborators so that multiple people can view and respond to
the submissions you collect.
